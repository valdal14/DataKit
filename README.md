[![Run DataKit macOS Tests](https://github.com/valdal14/DataKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/valdal14/DataKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

DataKit is a lightweight Swift **framework** designed to provide reusable and efficient implementations of fundamental data structures. Built with Swift's concurrency model in mind, these data structures are implemented as **actors** to ensure thread-safety and easy integration into concurrent applications. DataKit focuses on clarity, performance, and seamless integration across your Swift projects.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Core Data Structures:** Provides essential implementations like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables.
* **Concurrency Safe:** All data structures are implemented as `actor`s, providing built-in thread-safety and simplifying concurrent access.
* **Pure Swift:** Built entirely in Swift, ensuring seamless compatibility and idiomatic usage within Swift applications.
* **Efficiency:** Implementations are optimized for common operations, balancing performance with readability.
* **Type Safety:** Leverages custom protocols (`DataKitCompatible`, `DataKitHashable`) to enforce specific behaviors and compatibility for stored types.
* **Clear & Concise:** Code is written with clarity in mind, making it excellent for educational purposes or quick integration.

## üöÄ Implemented Data Structures

Currently, DataKit includes robust implementations for the following data structures:

* **`actor DataKitLinkedList<T: DataKitCompatible>`**: A versatile, thread-safe doubly linked list.
* **`actor DataKitStack<T: DataKitCompatible>`**: A thread-safe Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) collection.
* **`actor DataKitQueue<T: DataKitCompatible>`**: A thread-safe First-In, First-Out (FIFO) collection.
* **`actor DataKitHashTable<T: DataKitHashable>`**: An efficient, thread-safe key-value store, built using `DataKitHashTableFactory`.


## üì• Installation

To integrate DataKit into your Xcode project as a framework, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the DataKit repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/valdal14/DataKit.git](https://github.com/valdal14/DataKit.git)
```

### 2. Build the Framework

Open the DataKit Xcode project and build the framework target:

1.  Open `DataKit/DataKit.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2.  In the Xcode project navigator, select the `DataKit` target under `Targets`.
3.  Choose your desired build scheme (e.g., `DataKit iOS` or `DataKit macOS` depending on your target platform) and build the project (`Product` > `Build`).
4.  Once the build is successful, navigate to the `Products` folder in the project navigator (it might be hidden; expand it if necessary).
5.  Right-click on `DataKit.framework` and select `Show in Finder`. This will open the directory containing the built framework.

### 3. Add Framework to Your Project

Now, add the `DataKit.framework` file to your application or framework target:

1.  Open your own Xcode project.
2.  In your project navigator, select your project.
3.  Select your application or framework target under `Targets`.
4.  Go to the `General` tab.
5.  Scroll down to the `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` section.
6.  Click the `+` button to add new frameworks.
7.  Select `Add Other...` then `Add Files...`.
8.  Navigate to where you found `DataKit.framework` in Finder (from step 2.5) and select it.
9.  In the dialog that appears, choose `Do Not Embed` for a dynamic framework that your app links to (recommended for frameworks), or `Embed & Sign` if you're building an application and want the framework directly bundled.
10. Ensure that `DataKit.framework` is listed under `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content`.

You should now be able to `import DataKit` in your Swift files!

## üìö Usage

```swift
import DataKit
import Observation
import SwiftUI

// MARK: - ContentViewModel
final class ContentViewModel<T: DataKitCompatible> {
	private let list: DataKitLinkedList<T>
	
	init(list: DataKitLinkedList<T>) {
		self.list = list
	}
	
	func addElement(_ element: T) async {
		await list.add(element)
	}
	
	func getList() async -> String {
		await list.dump()
	}
	
	/// Implements additional methods....
}

// MARK: - Fruit - Type that conforms to DataKitCompatible
struct Fruit: DataKitCompatible, Identifiable {
	let id: UUID
	let name: String
	let emojy: String
}

private extension Fruit {
	static let mock: [Fruit] = [
		.init(id: UUID(), name: "Apple", emojy: "üçé"),
		.init(id: UUID(), name: "Banana", emojy: "üçå"),
		.init(id: UUID(), name: "Orange", emojy: "üçä"),
		.init(id: UUID(), name: "Pineapple", emojy: "üçç")
		]
}

// MARK: - ContentView
struct ContentView: View {
	@State var viewModel: ContentViewModel<Fruit> = .init(list: DataKitLinkedList<Fruit>())
	@State private var fruits: [Fruit] = Fruit.mock
	@State private var currentList: String = ""
	
    var body: some View {
		VStack {
			List(fruits) { fruit in
				HStack {
					Text(fruit.emojy)
					Text(fruit.name)
					Spacer()
					CTAButton(element: fruit, onTap: ({ selectedElement in
						await viewModel.addElement(selectedElement)
						currentList = await viewModel.getList()
					}))
				}
				.frame(minHeight: 60)
			}
			.listStyle(.inset)
			
			Text(currentList)
				.font(.caption)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

// MARK: - CTAButton View Helper
struct CTAButton: View {
	let element: Fruit
	let onTap: (Fruit) async -> Void
	var body: some View {
		Button {
			Task { await onTap(element) }
		} label: {
			Image(systemName: "plus.circle")
		}
	}
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
